# Performance Fixes: Endless Loading When Switching Tabs

## Problems Identified

1. **Service Workers Being Cleared on Every Mount**
   - The app was unregistering all service workers and clearing caches on every component mount
   - This caused the app to reload and re-fetch data whenever returning from another tab

2. **No Query Cache Persistence**
   - React Query cache was not persisted to localStorage
   - When switching tabs/browser focus, cached data was lost
   - App had to re-fetch all data from scratch

3. **AuthContext Re-initialization**
   - Authentication state was being re-fetched on every app mount
   - Caused unnecessary loading spinner when returning to the tab

4. **Non-optimal React Query Configuration**
   - `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` was good, but cache times were too short
   - No protection against constant re-fetching when switching contexts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Service Worker Cleanup (App.tsx)
- **Removed** the code that was unregistering service workers and clearing caches on every app mount
- This was causing unnecessary reloading when returning from other tabs
- PWA service workers can now persist properly

### 2. Added Query Cache Persistence (QueryProvider.tsx)
- **Increased cache times:**
  - `staleTime`: 10 minutes (was 5)
  - `gcTime`: 30 minutes (was 10)
- **Added localStorage persistence:**
  - Query cache is automatically saved to localStorage
  - Cache is restored when app reloads
  - This means data persists even when switching browser tabs
- **Improved reconnection handling:**
  - `refetchOnReconnect: 'always'` ensures fresh data when connection restored

### 3. Optimized AuthContext (AuthContext.tsx)
- **Added initialization guard using `useRef`:**
  - Auth check now only runs once per page load
  - Prevents re-fetching user profile when returning to tab
- **Improved profile caching:**
  - Profile data is cached in memory
  - Subsequent requests use cache instead of database queries
- **Session persistence:**
  - Authentication state now survives tab switches

## Files Modified

1. **src/context/QueryProvider.tsx**
   - Increased cache/stale times
   - Added localStorage persistence
   - Improved reconnection handling

2. **src/context/AuthContext.tsx**
   - Added `useRef` guard for initialization
   - Only initializes auth once per page load
   - Profile caching prevents redundant queries

3. **src/App.tsx**
   - Removed service worker unregistration
   - Removed cache clearing on mount
   - Cleaner component initialization

## Dependencies Added

- `@tanstack/react-query-persist-client`: Not needed (using manual implementation)
- All other dependencies were already present

## Performance Improvements

✅ **No more endless loading when switching tabs**
✅ **Data persists when returning to app**
✅ **Faster page loads due to cached data**
✅ **Reduced API calls**
✅ **Smoother user experience**

## Future Improvements

- Consider implementing background sync for real-time updates
- Add opt-in cache invalidation for critical data
- Monitor localStorage usage for large datasets
